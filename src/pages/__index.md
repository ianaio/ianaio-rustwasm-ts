IanaIO is a toolkit for building web applications and libraries with Rust and Wasm, composed of
modular crates. [IanaIO crates](https://github.com/ianaio/ianaio/tree/main/crates)
include example code, both in their respective `example` folders, and commented in their code, as well
as [API documentation](https://docs.rs/ianaio/).

## Using IanaIO

IanaIO is a *modular* toolkit: Each of its crates can either be used via the
umbrella `ianaio` crate, which re-exports all of them for a stream-lined, holistic
experience, or each crate can be used independently.
