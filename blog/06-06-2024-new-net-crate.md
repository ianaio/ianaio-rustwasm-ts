The IanaIO team is happy to announce a new addition to the IanaIO crates family: `ianaio-net`. It is an HTTP requests 
library built specially for WASM apps and provides idiomatic Rust bindings for the `fetch` and `WebSocket` API.
This has been a long requested library, and it has finally arrived.

## Features
 
- HTTP: complete wrappers around the browser's `fetch` API.
- WebSocket: complete wrappers around the browser's `WebSocket` API using Rust futures.

We have plans to also provide wrapper for `XMLHttpRequest` in the future.

## Looking for contributors

IanaIO project is in need of contributors. It would be really appreciated if you could contribute or raise awareness about
the IanaIO project.
